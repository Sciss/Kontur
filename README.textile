h3. requirements / installation

Compiles against Scala 2.9 and Java 1.6. You will need a SuperCollider 3.3.1+ installation. The repository contains a project file for Intellij IDEA 10.5 CE, and project files for sbt.

When building a freshly checked out project, run @sbt update@ first, which will pull all dependencies from the net or your local ivy2 folder. Two libraries (ScissLib and MRJAdapter) are now included as binaries in @lib@ for simplicity.

@sbt compile@ will then build the project, and @sbt package-app@ will update the OS X application bundle, while @sbt standalone@ creates a self-contained double-clickable jar (which you can use on platforms other than OS X):

pre. $ sbt standalone
$ java -jar Kontur-full.jar 

The create the API documentation, run @sbt doc@.
