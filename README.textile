h3. statement

Kontur is (C)opyright 2008-2010 Hanns Holger. It is released under the "GNU General Public License":http://github.com/Sciss/Kontur/blob/master/licenses/Kontur-License.txt .

h3. requirements / installation

Compiles against Scala 2.8.0.RC1 and Java 1.6. The repository contains a project file for Intellij IDEA 9 CE, and project files for sbt. Targets for sbt:

* @clean@
* @compile@
* @doc@
* @package@
* @standalone@
* @package-app@

The following dependancies currently need to be installed manually into the @lib@ folder:

* @scisslib.jar@ (from "sourceforge.net/projects/scisslib":http://sourceforge.net/projects/scisslib/ )
* @scissdsp.jar@ (from "github.com/Sciss/ScissDSP":http://github.com/Sciss/ScissDSP )

Furthermore, you need the following libraries:

* "ScalaInterpreterPane":http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaInterpreterPane
* "ScalaCollider":http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider
* "ScalaCollider-Swing":http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaColliderSwing
* "ScalaOSC":http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaOSC

You can install them by cloning their git repositories and building each with @sbt publish-local@. You also need the following libraries which should be automatically downloaded by sbt:

* @jsyntaxpane-0.9.5-b29.jar@
* @mrjadapter-1.1.jar@
* @prefuse-beta-20071021.jar@

After a fresh install, run @sbt update@ on Kontur before compiling. @sbt package-app@ will update the OS X application bundle, @sbt standalone@ creates a self-contained double-clickable jar:

pre. $ sbt standalone
$ java -jar Kontur-full.jar 

h3. todo

SonogramOverview should be replaced by the separate library now.
