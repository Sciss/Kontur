/**
 *  <code>BasicEvent</code> is the superclass of all events
 *  to be processed through <code>EventManager</code>s.
 *  It subclases <code>java.util.EventObject</code> and thus
 *  inherits an event <code>source</code> object.
 *  <p>
 *  The source
 *  is usually the object that caused the event to be dispatched,
 *  see the Timeline's setPosition for an example of the source
 *  usage. This allows objects which both dispatch and receive
 *  events to recognize if the event was fired by themselves,
 *  in which case they might optimize graphical updates or simply
 *  ignore the event, or by other objects.
 *  <p>
 *  Furthermore, a time tag (<code>getWhen()</code>) can be
 *  read to find out when the event was generated.
 *  <p>
 *  If events are dispatched at a heavy frequency, the
 *  <code>incorporate</code> method can help to shrink the
 *  queue by fusing events of the same type.
