<h2 align="center">Artistic License</h2>

<h3>Preamble</h3>

<p>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
	created through textual modification.</p>

<p>"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.</p>

<p>"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
	copyrights for the package.</p>

<p>"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
	this Package.</p>

<p>"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
	as a market that must bear the fee.)</p>

<p>"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
	under the same conditions they received it.</p>

    <li>accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.</li>

    <li>accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding

Package.</li>
